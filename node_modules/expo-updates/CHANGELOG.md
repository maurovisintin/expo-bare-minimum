### üõ† Breaking changes

### üéâ New features

- Added support for the **no-publish workflow**. In this workflow, release builds of both iOS and Android apps will create and embed a new update at build-time from the JS code currently on disk, rather than embedding a copy of the most recently published update. 
  - This means you no longer need to run `expo publish` before creating a release build.
  - The publish workflow is still supported, but it is no longer used by default in new projects, nor is it included in the setup instructions.
  - If you're upgrading from `0.1.x` and would like to use the no-publish workflow, make the following changes to your native projects:
    1. In your Xcode project, open the "Bundle Expo Assets" / "Bundle React Native code and images" build phase and replace the contents with the following:
    ```sh
    export NODE_BINARY=node
    ../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh
    ../node_modules/expo-updates/scripts/create-manifest-ios.sh
    ```
    2. Open the "Start Packager" build phase and remove the following lines, if they exist:
    ```sh
    if [ \"$CONFIGURATION\" == \"Release\" ]; then
      exit 0;
    fi
    ```
    3. Delete the `app.manifest` and `app.bundle` files from your Xcode project.
    4. Delete the `app.manifest` and `app.bundle` files from your `android/app/src/main/assets` directory.
    5. In `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the following diff:
    ```diff
      project.ext.react = [
         entryFile: "index.js",
    -    bundleInRelease: false,
         enableHermes: false
     ]
     apply from: '../../node_modules/react-native-unimodules/gradle.groovy'
     apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native/react.gradle"
    -apply from: "../../node_modules/expo-updates/expo-updates.gradle"
    +apply from: "../../node_modules/expo-updates/scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle"
    ```
- Added `Updates.updateId` and `Updates.releaseChannel` constant exports
